# Harsha Equation â€” Advanced QuTiP Notebook

This repository contains the computational supplement to the paper:

**Routhu, Harsha Vardhan (2025).  
_The Harsha Equation: A Canonical Law for Quantum Biology._**

The notebook implements and explores the **Harsha Equation**, a proposed canonical dynamical law of quantum biology that unifies coherence, tunneling, environment, and adaptive feedback into one framework.

## Features
- Two-site exciton transport model (photosynthesis case)
- Radical-pair magnetoreception model
- Enzyme tunneling toy model
- Adaptive feedback Hamiltonian (`H_bio(t)`)
- CPTP verification via Choi eigenvalues
- Entropy production analysis (thermodynamic consistency)
- Entanglement diagnostics (log-negativity, concurrence)
- Example parameter sweeps and visualizations

The code uses **[QuTiP](https://qutip.org/)** for quantum dynamics simulation.
